#Yun CTA Train Status

A train tracking device, powered by an Arduino Yun and the [CTA Train Tracker API](http://www.transitchicago.com/developers/traintracker.aspx). Push the button, and live train arrival times for your favorite stop are displayed on the LCD.

A Python script uploaded to the Linux side of the Yun queries the API and returns results to the Arduino sketch in a ready-to-display format.
